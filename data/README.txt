# Notes on data sources

## csv files on companies

These are based on the data scraped in scrapers/base.py. They were generated by exporting CSV directly from postgres.

- **rigs.csv** -- scraped details of oil rigs in west africa

Then, 2 spreadsheets generated when we tried to match the company names in rigs.csv to companies in opencorporates

- **companies.csv** -- details of the top 5 matches for each company search
- **company_names.csv** -- count of total number of name matches for companies in opencorporates (capped at 250)
